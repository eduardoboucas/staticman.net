## What is Staticman

`Staticman` is an OpenSource application written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) that exposes a simple RESTful HTTP API that *static* websites can consume in order to add dynamically generated content to their pages, like comments for example.

## How does it work

In the default configuration setup `Staticman` acts as a bridge between your web pages and the GitHub repository where the code of your static website lives, i.e.:

`Web client <-> Staticman API <-> GitHub repository`

The main use case is the following: whenever a web client generates new content (submitting a POST request from an HTML form for example) `Staticman` will receive that request and, if valid, will create a related new pull request in the GitHub repository with all the HTML form content (and more...) to be reviewed and, if it is approved, merged into the static site git repo.

Usually static sites are setup with some kind of CI/CD integration so any commit pushed to the main branch (including those generated by `Staticman`) will trigger a new build that will add the new comment to the web page.

## Where does it run

`Staticman` can be hosted on any platform that runs a relatively recent NodeJS runtime and can bind its TCP/IP port to the public Internet.

We recommend [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which is very straightforward to setup and provides a free tier thats should be enough to support any low traffic website.

Please refer to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section for instructions on how to set up your personal `Staticman` instance
